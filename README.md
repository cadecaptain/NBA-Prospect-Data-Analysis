# NBA-Prospect-Data-Analysis
The NBA is currently in an offensive driven era, and when looking at recent and upcoming lottery drafts, the goal of many NBA scouts is to find a positionally fluid, big-scoring, superstar who can be impactful in many different statistical boxes. This can be hard to predict however, and in recent draft classes, there are very few lotteries where the best regarded player today was selected with the number one overall pick. This data analysis research paper attempts to use the statistics that recent lottery draft classes, or top 14 picks in any given draft, have recorded, stretching back to 2011. We then will use this information to make predictions of how the different statistics of each player from the draft class of 2021 changes throughout their NBA careers. The purpose of this statistical analysis is to attempt to find patterns in draftees with the goal being to model the potential futures of the youngest class of NBA players and to improve the research that goes into drafting the leagueâ€™s prospects. This is done using statistical averages from the draft classes 2011-2020, as well as exploring the use of neural networks and machine learning algorithms to discover what statistical patterns we can look for in upcoming NBA draftees.
